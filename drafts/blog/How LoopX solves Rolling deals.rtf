\f0\fs24 \cf0 Why Rolling Deals Are Dangerous \'97 and How LoopX Helps You Know When to Revive Them\
\
There are two foundational truths in enterprise sales:\
\
1. Time kills deals.\
\
If a deal slows down, it usually stops.\
\
2. Bad deals don\'92t die fast \'97 they die slow.\
\
They drag out.\
They stall.\
They sparkle with false hope.\
Then they quietly slip away.\
\
The Trap: Rolling Deals Across Quarters\
\
Many orgs make this mistake:\
\
Q1: \'93They need more time.\'94\
Q2: \'93They said next quarter for sure.\'94\
Q3: \'93Budget opened up in Q4.\'94\
Q4: \'93Let\'92s roll it one more time.\'94\
\
But if there\'92s no signal change, there\'92s no deal progression.\
\
What counts as signal change?\
\
Internal:\
\
New buyer activity\
\
New call\
\
New email\
\
New stakeholder involvement\
\
POC movement\
\
Legal movement\
\
External:\
\
New funding\
\
New layoffs or hiring\
\
New leadership\
\
New category interest\
\
Competitor collapse\
\
Regulatory trigger\
\
Market shift\
\
Tech stack changes\
\
If none of these shift, the deal should be sunset \'97 not rolled.\
\
Why LoopX Helps You Resurrect Deals the Right Way\
\
LoopX now includes a Quick Wins feature:\
\
You can upload dead deals, and the engine will automatically analyze:\
\
What external signals have changed\
\
What internal signals revived\
\
Whether conditions are now favorable\
\
Whether the trigger event aligns with your solution\
\
Whether the account is \'93waking up\'94 in your category\
\
This prevents wasted time on zombie deals and helps you revive the right ones \'97 at the right moment.\
\
Time kills all deals.\
But signals bring the good ones back to life.}
