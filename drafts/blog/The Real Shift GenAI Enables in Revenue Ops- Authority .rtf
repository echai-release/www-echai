\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Real Shift GenAI Enables in Revenue Ops: Authority\
\
GenAI only changes sales when it does three things managers cannot do at scale.\
\
This is not about productivity or automation.\
It\'92s about authority.\
\
1. Externalizing Truth\
\
Sales decisions are often made using internal signals:\
CRM activity, rep notes, meeting summaries.\
\
GenAI expands the frame by continuously reading external reality:\
\
company strategy and positioning\
\
hiring and org changes\
\
funding and financial signals\
\
product launches and regulatory pressure\
\
customer language and market behavior\
\
Because this data is continuously monitored, it establishes a new baseline.\
\
The core question shifts from:\
\'93What did the rep do?\'94\
to\
\'93Is this company behaving like a buyer right now?\'94\
\
2. Normalizing Judgment\
\
Today, deal judgment is subjective and personal.\
\
When managers disagree with reps, it creates friction and inconsistency.\
\
GenAI makes judgment procedural.\
\
Instead of relying on opinion, the system evaluates evidence and states:\
\'93This is not a buying moment because key conditions are missing.\'94\
\
This reduces emotional conflict and increases consistency across teams.\
\
3. Making Uncertainty Explicit\
\
Uncertainty is usually hidden in sales workflows.\
\
Deals remain in commit even when confidence is low.\
\
GenAI can explicitly label uncertainty:\
\
unproven deals\
\
missing stakeholders\
\
deals revived due to changed external conditions\
\
This behavior is new.\
Most systems avoid it because it feels risky.\
\
But it is necessary for trust.\
\
The Future Way of Working\
\
With GenAI:\
\
managers ask systems for second opinions\
\
forecast calls focus on evidence, not narratives\
\
reps are asked to close gaps, not defend optimism\
\
pipeline hygiene becomes continuous\
\
The biggest shift is simple:\
\
Deal reality becomes something you can ask for \'97 not something you argue about.\
\
That is the real value GenAI brings to revenue operations.\
\
Authority.}
