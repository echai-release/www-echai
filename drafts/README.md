## Drafts

This folder is for **unpublished** content that should **not** be accessible on `www.enterprisechai.com` yet.

### Blog drafts

- Put blog drafts in `drafts/blog/`.
- Use one file per post, named by slug, for example:
  - `drafts/blog/what-did-we-actually-sell.md`

When a post is ready to go live, we’ll generate/publish it into the repo root as `<slug>.html` and add it to `blog.html`.
