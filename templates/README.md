## Templates

This folder contains HTML templates used by `scripts/publish_blogs.py`.

- `post.html`: Template for individual blog posts (`<slug>.html` in the repo root).
- `blog.html`: Template for the blog listing page (`blog.html` in the repo root).

The templates are intentionally very close to the current site HTML so the generated pages match the existing look & feel.
